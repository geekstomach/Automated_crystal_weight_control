The automated power control systems crystal growth by EFG method
The automated control systems have been developed for the growth of various sapphire crystals by edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG). Automated crystal weight control is based on the analysis of the behaviour of the mass rate deviation at all stages of the growth process (seeding, crystal expansion, stationary growth, in-situ cross-sectional changing). The maintenance of the mass rate deviation in a certain range provides the crystal quality control as well as crystal shape control.
